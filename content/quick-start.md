Honkai: Star Rail is HoYoverse’s newest addition to the Honkai universe after their hit hack-and-slash game Honkai Impact 3rd. Like any new game, going in blind and experiencing Honkai: Star Rail for the first time can be quite a refreshing and immersive experience for most players. To maximise your experience, however, knowing a few key things about the game beforehand can help you make the most of your time and avoid any potential frustration or confusion. If you’re the kind of player who likes to be prepared and have a better understanding of what you’re getting into, then here are some key things to keep in mind before you start playing Honkai: Star Rail.

# What’s It All About?

Honkai: Star Rail is a thrilling space adventure that takes place in a futuristic world within the HoYoverse multiverse. The game features a gacha system where players can collect different characters, each with their own abilities and strengths. Players can also upgrade their starship and equipment to improve their chances of success in battles. Unlike the typical hack-and-slash mechanics of Honkai Impact 3rd, however, Honkai: Star Rail is a turn-based strategy game that requires players to carefully plan their moves and use their characters’ abilities strategically to defeat their enemies. Combine these mechanics with the typical RPG and gacha elements you’ll find in Genshin Impact, and you’ve got a game that offers a unique and exciting experience for players.

The gameplay revolves around building a team of four characters and using their unique abilities to battle against enemies in turn-based combat. Each character has their own unique look and playstyle, but they are distinguished by their rarity, element, and their class. Players can also equip their characters with different weapons and gear to further enhance their abilities. For every enemy encounter, players must strategically choose which characters to use and which abilities to activate to gain an advantage over their opponents.
